# simple-phonebook-app
This is a simple phonebook console application I have written in c++ using codeblocks

It has following functions: 
1. Add new contact         
2. Search user by phone        
3. Search user by username    
4. Delete contact 

I wrote another function(phone_not_valid) that validates if the phone number is valid hungarian format.
